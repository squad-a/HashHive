# HashHive üöÄ

HashHive is a dynamic and modern blog website developed as part of the Hashnode hackathon. This project brings together the skills and creativity of Ankit, Aman, and Ritik to create a seamless and engaging platform for bloggers.

## Technology Used üíª

- React (Typescript) : A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The entire website is built on React components, providing a modular and efficient structure.

- Material-UI (MUI) : The UI components of the website are designed using MUI, which offers a set of pre-designed React components following the Material Design principles. This not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves the overall user experience.

- Hashnode (API) : Hashnode API allows developers to interact with the Hashnode blogging platform. It supports features like fetching user and post data, creating new posts, updating user profiles, and managing comments. The API is RESTful, utilizing standard HTTP methods, and requires authentication through API keys. Comprehensive documentation is available to guide developers in integrating Hashnode functionality into their applications.

## Features üåü

- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- Dynamic Content: Blog and other dynamic content are managed through Hashnode API (GraphQL), providing a flexible and scalable solution for updating and adding new content.

- Interactive UI: Leveraging the capabilities of React, the website features an interactive and dynamic user interface, making the user experience engaging and enjoyable.
